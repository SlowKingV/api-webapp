### JavaScript capstone project - API-based webapp
In this project, we must choose an external API and develop a page with comments, pop-up with a form, and a likes button.
We are using Javascript with ES6, HTML, and CSS through Webpack and Jest for testing.
Our tasks was centered on the Homepage, getting the information from an API, and creating the Likes button functionality.
And a Pop-up with all the information added with a contact form to add a comment on each movie.

Any suggestions are welcome! Thank you
